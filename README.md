## Development

#### (Optional) Register PagerDuty App

If you wish to maintain + deploy your own version of PagerDuty Live, we recommend registering a new OAuth app as follows:

- Within PagerDuty developer mode, [register a new app](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTY5-register-an-app)
- [Add OAuth 2.0 workflow](<(https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjExMDI5NTcz-o-auth-2-0-functionality#add-oauth-20-functionality-to-your-app)>) to the app and update the URL to the app entrypoint  
  (see GitHub deployment steps below as an example)

#### Local Development

1. Install [NodeJS v16.13](https://nodejs.org/tr/blog/release/v16.13.0/) (or switch using [`asdf install`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf))

2. Install `craco` via `$ yarn install @craco/craco --save --global`  
   (NB - you may need to reload terminal session to use the alias)

3. `$ git clone` repo to desired destination and `$ cd pd-live-react` into directory.

4. (_Optional_) Create `.env` file in project root with overriding configuration (see section below for details)

5. Install dependencies with `$ yarn install` and run application locally using `$ yarn start`  
   The app will be available under http://localhost:3000/pd-live-react

#### Environment Overrides

The following _optional_ parameters can be used in a `.env` file to override PagerDuty Live during local serve (`yarn start`):  
| Parameter | Usage |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `REACT_APP_PD_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | PagerDuty OAuth App client ID (created upon registering app) |
| `REACT_APP_PD_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | PagerDuty OAuth App client secret (created upon registering app) |
| `REACT_APP_PD_USER_TOKEN` | PagerDuty [Personal API Token](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#generating-a-personal-rest-api-key); this will override OAuth login workflow if set|
| `REACT_APP_PD_SUBDOMAIN_ALLOW_LIST` | Comma separated list of allowed subdomains (e.g. `acme-prod,acme-dev`) |
